	<p>If a prospective customer clicks on your Link, a cookie will live on the prospect’s computer for 7 days to track any transactions.</p>
	<p>You and we will cooperate in good faith to develop and implement such Links. Each Link will permit recipients to navigate directly to a page on Our website or related site, designated by us via a special tagged link format. You will be solely responsible for integrating the Links into your site to properly enable sales tracking, and we will not be responsible for your failure to do so, including to the extent such failure may result in any reductions of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you under this Agreement.  Referral Fees are only payable if they can be tracked to you with your affiliate ID.  We cannot track referrals for users who do not accept cookies or if they delete Your cookie.  </p>
